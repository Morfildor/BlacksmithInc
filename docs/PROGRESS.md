# Progress — 2026-10-09 (session 6)

## Current phase
P7 in progress. Launch content is the engine default and balance v2 is tuned against it; all 24 signature recipes,
the Strange Weapon Fragment event and End Day event-log compaction landed the same day (parallel agents, merged).

## Session 6 focus: gameplay depth (balance v3, app 0.4.0)
The owner asked for function and features over UI ("not fun yet, not much in it"; the UI will be redesigned later).
Added in `:core`, each with one plain UI surface: affix effects, elite foes and warlords, hero ambitions, element
commissions, the Salvage / Hone / Arm the watch shop actions, workshop tools, a siege forecast. Design, numbers and
simulator evidence are in DECISIONS.md ("Balance v3: gameplay depth").

## What exists
- `core/` pure Kotlin engine: RNG, slice + launch content catalogs (launch is the default), balance config v2, model,
  commands, End Day resolver, crafting with techniques and all 24 signature recipes, market, hero AI with retirement/
  guilds/mentoring, battles/sieges with weapon seizure, world-event pool (23 events + 2 deterministic rules = all 25 GDD
  events), legacy with famous-blade returns, Gazette, JSON save codec with a migration scaffold, End Day event-log
  compaction (30-day window, history-grade types kept), headless simulator (GDD policy set, `--content`,
  `--rarityTable`, `--impactPolicy`, `BALANCED_INVEST` purchasing rule with `--reserve`, `BALANCED_REPUTED`
  pricing, forge-damage overrides, JSON report, perf probe), reputation/loyalty depth (bounded price ceiling,
  loyalty-weighted commission patrons, premium/regular Gazette records), weapon-history cap, a checked-in v1 save
  fixture. Balance v3 (session 6): affix effects (bane, elite, heal, loot, wound, shatter, self-harm), elite
  encounters, warlord sieges, hero ambitions, element commissions, `Salvage` / `Hone` / `DonateWeapon` / `BuyTool`
  commands, workshop tools, `siegeForecast`, `BALANCED_ACTIVE` simulator policy, trade-ins and patrol pay. 122 JVM tests.
- `app/` Compose portrait workshop (session 4 layout: three-stat top bar, pinned forge summary over collapsible
  auto-advancing steps, row-based market, per-panel tip banners, single End Day action, full-width paper day report;
  principles in DECISIONS.md; session 5: title/run-end on the spacing tokens with one primary action, Town lists
  every faction with pressure and weakness, screen-reader descriptions on disabled actions), six panels, technique chips,
  newspaper day report with stepped replay, blessing choice (dismissable for the day), run-end/legacy screen; Room
  atomic save store; DataStore settings (reduced motion, seen tips). Hand-made pixel art on every screen.
- `tools/pixelart/import_assets.py` (slices concept sheets, copies selected pack sprites, prunes stale imports),
  `generate_assets.py` (placeholders), `tools/emulator/smoke.sh` (device loop). `docs/ART_BRIEF.md` is the brief.
- Animated siege diorama in the day report (artist pack frames), dead/retired markers, milestone burst on the result
  card for signature or epic+ weapons.
- Weapon master sheet sliced into 336 `weapon_<family>_<row>_<level>` sprites with a generated `ui/WeaponArt.kt`
  lookup; 488 hand-made sprites in total (94 sheet slices + 336 weapons + 58 pack sprites).

## Obstacles hit and resolved
- Launch content with the v1 siege numbers gave 0 survived sieges: heroes always fought the first faction by ID and
  three factions' growth (15/day) saturated pressure. Fixed by targeting the most pressing faction and growth 4/3/2;
  run length then retuned through forge damage (24 + 50x(ratio-1)) with siege modifier 2.0.
- The quality formula could not separate six core tiers (20-point core span vs 27-point roll); base 25 + 6/tier
  spreads them. Tier 5 remains a rare/epic split; the excellent top-tier pairs are 33-41 % legendary by design.
- Two tests encoded slice facts (12 signatures = 4 per slice family; `restless_graves` ineligible without
  Hollowbound): the signature test now checks the launch catalog (24 recipes); the world-event test expects the launch
  factions and the most pressing faction for Successful Patrol.
- The RANDOM policy reported 53 "hard-lock" days on launch content: it drew unaffordable moonsteel. It now draws only
  obtainable materials; 0 hard-locks in all runs.

## Known limitations
- Starting energy/gold upgrades still measure ~0 days even under the `BALANCED_INVEST` purchasing rule: sales are
  demand-bound (14-21 per run for every policy) and day-1 heroes hold ~85 gold, so the extra premium weapons do not
  sell before the first sieges. Evidence and proposals in DECISIONS.md ("Balance review at 10,000 seeds").
- `Weapon.history` combat entries are capped (10 per weapon), but the per-weapon FORGED/INHERITED entries and the
  `weapons` map itself still grow with every weapon forged (930 weapons, 1,721 entries after a forced 400-day run;
  2,330 weapons after 1,000 days); lost/destroyed weapons are never pruned. The next list to watch.
- `panel_gazette`/`panel_journal` frames and the pack's signature weapon variants are not used (the pack's 16 px
  signature sprites would clash with the 64 px concept weapons; signatures show their name and burst instead).
- Balance v3 at 10,000 seeds and the per-tool / per-affix sweeps are in DECISIONS.md: tools buy no run length (the
  signboard is capped out by `maxCustomersPerDay`), single affix effects sit inside the noise floor and warlords are
  never fought; the recommendations there (signboard effect, whetstone 120/300, warlord pressure 45-50, affix
  magnitudes) are not applied yet.
- The simulator's other policies ignore the new shop actions, so their rows measure a smith who never uses them.
- Sell rate is still modest (16-23 % at fair prices): trade-ins and patrol pay raised sales by about a third, but
  most visits now end NOT_BETTER (a hero only buys an upgrade). Salvage, Hone and the watch use the surplus.
- Package name is still `com.example.blacksmithproject`; no release signing.
- `GameEngine.RULES_VERSION` stays 1 although v2 changed hero targeting and RNG draw order and session-4 commission
  patron weighting changes which hero asks on a given seed; bump with the first release.
- Git: `main` tracks https://github.com/Morfildor/BlacksmithInc; commit and push per verified milestone. App version 0.4.0 (versionCode 4).

## Next executable actions (P7)
0. More gameplay, in the order the harness suggests: more reasons to buy (most visits end NOT_BETTER; newcomers,
   sidearms or wear would widen demand), then the v3 review recommendations in DECISIONS.md (signboard effect,
   whetstone 120/300, warlord pressure 45-50, affix magnitudes).
1. Measure starting gold/energy upgrades by first-siege champion power or first tier-4+ sale (DECISIONS proposal a)
   instead of run length; hero first-week purchasing power is the lever if run length must move.
2. 720x1280 pass over every panel; nav labels are tight at font scale 1.5.
3. Register the first migration step against `saves/v1_forced_seed4242_day61.json` when the envelope schema changes;
   prune or cap the `weapons` map (lost/destroyed records) if 1,000-day saves matter.
4. Package rename from `com.example.blacksmithproject`, release signing.
